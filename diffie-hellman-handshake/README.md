# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Handshake Demo    

# Introduction
There are many different ways to exchange information to pair the two devices using the MTE. One way to exchange information when in a zero-knowledge environment is by using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange as a secure way to exchange MTE seed values. This sample demonstrates how to use a Diffie-Hellman Algorithm to exchange the entropy value between two different devices.

This sample contains a Python client side handshake sample that uses the Eclypses Python package to perform the Diffie-Hellman key creation.

# Getting Started
The Handshake sample is meant to be run against a local API or the Eclypses public sample API. Ensure the correct rest api host url and port are set in the Program.py file near the beginning before compiling and running the sample.
