# MTE MKE Chunking Demo    

## Introduction
The Managed Key Encryption (MKE) Add-On replaces the core encoder and decoder, which only do tokenization, with an encoder and decoder that combine standard encryption with tokenization. This allows much larger data to take advantage of the MTE technology without significantly increasing the data size.

The MKE can be used two different ways. The first is identical to how the core MTE operates, encoding and decoding an entire message in one call. The MKE is designed to work with large amounts of data so there may be times when the user does not want to encode and decode all the data in one call. Examples may be when streaming video, audio or uploading a large file. In these cases the MTE MKE chunking calls can be used.

This sample contains a Python sample that reads in a large file in chunks and saves the encoded data to a new file. After this is completed the encoded file is then read in and decoded, creating a new file with the decoded data.

## Getting Started
This sample is meant to be run locally and does not require an outside API. It does require the user to add their MTE libraries to the code for it to work correctly. 

 - The MTE library should be put in the testChunker directory

This sample currently works with MTE 3.0.x. To use the sample please do the following:

  - Copy all files from the "/src/py" directory in the MTE sdk to the testChunker directory.
  - Copy the MTE libary from the "lib" directory (mte.dll, libmte.so, or libmte.dylib) into the testChunker directory.
