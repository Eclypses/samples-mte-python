# MTE MKE Chunking File Upload Demo    

## Introduction
The Managed Key Encryption (MKE) Add-On replaces the core encoder and decoder, which only do tokenization, with an encoder and decoder that combine standard encryption with tokenization. This allows much larger data to take advantage of the MTE technology without significantly increasing the data size.

This sample contains Python sample code that allows the user to upload a file to the API. The MKE encodes the file contents and sends it up to the server. Once it reaches the server it is decoded and then saved to an upload directory. If successful an encoded success message is returned, if not an error message is returned.

## Getting Started
This sample must be run in concert with an API server. In these samples there is a C# API Server Sample you can run locally or Eclypses provides an API at https://dev-echo.eclypses.com. 

It does require the user to add their MTE libraries to the code for it to work correctly. 

 - The MTE library should be put in the MteConsoleUploadTest folder

This sample currently works with MTE 3.0.x. To use the sample please do the following:

  - Copy all files from the "/src/py" directory in the MTE sdk to the  directory.
  - Copy the MTE libary from the "lib" directory (mte.dll, libmte.so, or libmte.dylib) into the MteConsoleUploadTest directory.
