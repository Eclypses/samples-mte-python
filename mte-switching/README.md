# MTE Switching Demo    

## Introduction
The MTE software allows you to use the same MTE state for the MTE Core, FLEN and MKE as long as each is initialized using the same options. A single client can switch between these based on the size of the message or other environmental needs. Below is an example that uses the MTE Core to transmit the login information and then uses the MKE to upload a file.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
>Each side must use the same MTE "type" in a single transmission in order to decode and encode the messages, for example if the message is encoded using the MTE Core it must be decoded using the MTE Core.

The code samples for each section show the client side using a console application, the operations on the server side are almost identical. Each section breaks out portions of the code, at the bottom of this page the full program files are also available for the client as well as the server.

## Getting Started
This sample must be run in concert with an API server. In these samples there is a C# API Server Sample you can run locally or Eclypses provides an API at https://dev-echo.eclypses.com. 

It does require the user to add their MTE libraries to the code for it to work correctly. 

 - The MTE library should be put in the MteSwitchingTest directory

This sample currently works with MTE 3.0.x. To use a different version of the MTE please do the following:

  - Copy files from the "/src/py" directory in the MTE archive to the include directory.
  - Copy the corresponding MTE libary into the MteSwitchingTest directory.
